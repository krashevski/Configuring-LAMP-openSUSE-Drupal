Configuring LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) by operating system openSUSE to CMS Drupal

There are four scripts for the management of CMS Drupal and LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) under the operating system openSUSE:

1. install-lamp.sh
2. install-drupal.sh
3. lamp-save-dumps.sh
4. lamp-restore-data.sh

Drupal installation directory /home/user/public_html/ in the same place may be located the scripts or any convenient location to you.

Script remove-composer.sh for development.

These scenarios have been published in the book: Configuring LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) for openSUSE to CMS Drupal, <a href="https://www.lap-publishing.com/catalog/details/store/fr/book/978-3-659-59361-1/Настройка-lamp-linux+apache+mysql+php-под-opensuse-для-cms-drupal" target="_blank">Настройка LAMP (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) под openSUSE для CMS Drupal</a>
